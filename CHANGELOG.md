## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `examples/notebooks/` — six scenario-based Jupyter notebooks that walk
  through the Python API (`create_components()`, `search_pipeline.search()`,
  `index_engine.index_path()`, storage mixins, and `MemtomemStore` for
  LangGraph). Covers hello-memory, bulk indexing + filters, session /
  scratch / recall, search tuning, a two-node LangGraph agent, and the
  full memory lifecycle (hash-diff incremental re-index on edit,
  single-chunk delete via `storage.delete_chunks`, orphan cleanup via
  `delete_by_source`, and `force=True` full re-embed). Each notebook
  runs against a throwaway temp directory so it cannot touch the user's
  real `~/.memtomem/` setup.
- Notebook 02 includes a "Korean with the kiwipiepy tokenizer" section
  that prints the token stream produced by `unicode61` vs. `kiwipiepy`
  side by side and runs the same query under each configuration.
- `examples/notebooks/README.md` now has a "How memories are stored"
  section that explains the file-backed (`index_file` path used by
  notebooks 01/02/04/05/06) vs DB-only (`create_session`, `scratch_set`,
  … used by notebook 03) storage paths and the shared temp directory
  layout every notebook relies on.
- `docs/guides/hands-on-tutorial.md` gained steps 3.6 / 3.7 covering the
  file lifecycle from the MCP side: reading `mem_index` `Indexed` /
  `Skipped (unchanged)` / `Deleted (stale)` stats after a file edit,
  `mem_index force=true` full re-embed for model swaps, and
  `mem_do action="orphans"` (dry-run → apply) to clean up chunks whose
  source file was deleted. Step 1.2 now also documents the
  `MEMTOMEM_TOOL_MODE` env var and which tutorial steps use the `mem_do`
  routing vs top-level calls.

### Fixed
- `MemtomemStore.index()` (LangGraph adapter) and the `mm` shell `index`
  command called a nonexistent `IndexEngine.index_directory()` method and
  would crash at runtime. Routed both to `index_path()` and added
  regression tests in `tests/test_langgraph.py`.
- `docs/guides/hands-on-tutorial.md` steps 3.2 / 3.3 / 3.4 used to call
  `mem_batch_add` / `mem_edit` / `mem_delete` as top-level tools, but
  those are non-core actions — readers following the tutorial with the
  default MCP config (`MEMTOMEM_TOOL_MODE=core`) would hit "tool not
  found" errors. All three call sites now go through
  `mem_do(action="...", params={...})`, matching the default tool set.
- `docs/guides/hands-on-tutorial.md` `mem_status` / `mem_stats` example
  outputs had drifted from the real formats in
  `server/tools/status_config.py`. Step 1.3 showed a one-line
  `Chunks: 0 | Sources: 0` form that the code has never produced;
  step 3.5 showed `Chunks: 12 | Sources: 4 | Storage: sqlite` as the
  `mem_stats` response. Both now show the actual multi-line output
  (`memtomem Status` header with `Storage` / `DB path` / `Embedding` /
  `Dimension` / `Top-K` / `RRF k` and an `Index stats` section for
  `mem_status`; `Memory index statistics:` header plus bullet list
  for `mem_stats`).
- `docs/guides/user-guide.md` `mem_index` examples likewise did not
  match the real "`Indexing complete: ...`" block — the Index-a-directory
  response was `"Indexed 47 files (312 chunks)"` and the Incremental
  re-indexing response used a `"3 new, 2 updated, 1 deleted"` phrasing
  that does not correspond to any code path. Both now use the real
  multi-line format (`Files scanned` / `Total chunks` / `Indexed` /
  `Skipped (unchanged)` / `Deleted (stale)` / `Duration`) and the
  section now explains that an edited section contributes to **both**
  `Indexed` (new hash) and `Deleted (stale)` (old hash) because the
  diff is hash-based.

## [0.1.3] — 2026-04-10

Quality & security audit: 79+ fixes across nine audit rounds.

### Security
- Path traversal guard on source validation and symlink resolution.
- Webhook SSRF protection (private IP / internal host blocking).
- Recursion depth limit for structured-data (JSON/YAML/TOML) chunking.
- Binary file detection so non-text files are skipped during indexing.
- Namespace validation and shell crash guard.
- File size limit enforcement during ingestion.

### Fixed
- Cache race conditions and invalidation gaps in the search pipeline.
- Index lock handling and rollback consistency on partial failures.
- WAL checkpoint handling to prevent DB growth.
- Retention policy correctness and persistence reliability.
- Batch query correctness under concurrent access.
- Resource leaks (file handles, DB connections, embedder clients).
- Float epsilon handling in scoring; overlap cap enforcement in chunking.
- Cache TTL snapshot and lock-timeout races.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-04-10

### Added
- Session and activity tracking CLI: `mm session start/end/list/events`,
  `mm activity log`, and `mm session wrap -- CMD` to wrap headless
  processes with a session lifecycle.
- PostToolUse and Stop hooks for automatic activity logging.
- Timezone config: `MEMTOMEM_TIMEZONE=Asia/Seoul` (display only, storage
  stays UTC).
- Web UI sessions panel with event type badges, expandable metadata, and
  client-side filtering.
- `parent_context` and `file_context` metadata on chunks for better
  retrieval context.

### Changed
- Sibling heading sections (same parent) merge when short to reduce chunk
  fragmentation. Top-level `mem_add` entries stay independent of sibling
  merge.
- Token estimation uses a dynamic ratio: 4 for English, 2 for Korean.

### Fixed
- SQLite `busy_timeout=10` prevents "database is locked" when the CLI and
  MCP server access storage concurrently.
- MCP server PID lock warns about duplicate instances instead of silently
  racing on writes.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-04-10

### Added
- `mm init --non-interactive` mode for CI and automation.
- Project-scoped install support via `uv add memtomem`.

### Changed
- README optimized as a GitHub profile landing page (163 → 115 lines);
  PyPI badge and ecosystem section added.
- `mm init` docs clarified to drop the unneeded `uv run` prefix after
  `uv tool install`; README Quick Start leads with explicit install +
  wizard.

### Fixed
- `mem_add` produced duplicate chunks because `index_entry` and
  `index_file` were two separate indexing paths. Removed `index_entry`
  and routed all ingestion through `index_file`.
- `mm init` wrote `MEMORY_DIRS` as a plain string into `.mcp.json`,
  which crashed the server on startup. The wizard now serialises list
  env vars as JSON (#13).
- `mm web` surfaces an actionable error when the `[web]` extra is
  missing instead of failing with a bare `ModuleNotFoundError` (#14).

## [0.1.0.post1] — 2026-04-10

Metadata-only re-release; no code changes.

### Changed
- Corporate ownership recorded as DAPADA Inc. alongside the memtomem
  contributors in package authors and `LICENSE`.
- `Issues` URL added to PyPI project metadata (#12).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-08

Initial open-source release.

### Core (memtomem)
- MCP server with 72 tools + `mem_do` meta-tool (63 actions, aliases)
- CLI (`memtomem` / `mm`): init, search, add, recall, index, config, context, shell, web, watchdog
- Web UI dashboard: search, sources, tags, sessions, health report
- Hybrid search pipeline: BM25 (FTS5) + dense vectors (sqlite-vec) + RRF fusion
- Multi-stage pipeline: query expansion → parallel retrieval → RRF → time-decay → reranking → MMR → access boost → context-window expansion
- Context-window search (small-to-big retrieval): `search(context_window=N)` + `mem_expand` action
- Tool modes: `core` (9 tools), `standard` (~32), `full` (72)
