# Run tests
uv run pytest -m "not ollama"          # skip Ollama-dependent tests

## Project Structure

- `packages/memtomem/` — Core: MCP server, CLI, web UI, search, storage, indexing
- `packages/memtomem-claude-plugin/` — Claude Code plugin (experimental)

The STM proxy gateway lives in a separate repository: [memtomem/memtomem-stm](https://github.com/memtomem/memtomem-stm).

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Keep changes focused — one feature or fix per PR
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Ensure `uv run ruff check` and `uv run ruff format --check` pass
5. Ensure `uv run pytest -m "not ollama"` passes
6. Write a clear commit message describing the "why"
7. Sign the CLA on your first pull request (see below)

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Before we can merge your first pull request, you need to sign the
[Contributor License Agreement](CLA.md). The CLA Assistant bot will
automatically comment on your PR with instructions — you sign by replying
with:

> I have read the CLA Document and I hereby sign the CLA

You only need to sign once per GitHub account per repository. Because
memtomem and [memtomem-stm](https://github.com/memtomem/memtomem-stm) are
separate repositories with independent signature stores, contributors who
open pull requests against both projects need to sign in each repository
(still one-time per account). Your signature is stored in
`signatures/v1/cla.json` in whichever repository you signed.

The CLA is adapted from the Apache Software Foundation Individual
Contributor License Agreement with one additional section covering future
licensing rights. This preserves DAPADA Inc.'s ability to adopt different
license terms for the Work in the future (for example, a dual-licensing
arrangement) without needing to re-collect consent from every contributor.
The CLA does not change the current license of the Work, which remains
Apache License 2.0.

For questions about the CLA, contact contact@dapada.co.kr.
