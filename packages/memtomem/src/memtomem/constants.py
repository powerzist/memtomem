# Multi-agent buckets. The ``agent-runtime:<agent-id>`` namespace is a
# *convenience* isolation boundary, not a security boundary — see the
# multi-agent guide for the threat model. Provider-ingestion namespace
# prefixes (``claude-memory:``, ``gemini-memory:``, ``codex-memory:``)
# stay as locally-defined literals in ``cli/ingest_cmd.py`` for now;
# promoting them here belongs in the same change that wires them up,
# not this PR.
#
# ``agent_id`` is interpolated directly into ``AGENT_NAMESPACE_PREFIX``
# without further escaping, so every entry point that builds an
# agent-runtime namespace MUST first run ``validate_agent_id`` on the
# user-provided id. Accepted charset: ``[A-Za-z0-9._-]`` (1–64 chars,
# no leading dash, not ``"."`` / ``".."``). Rejecting ``:``, ``/``,
# ``..``, whitespace, and control characters keeps malformed-but-stored
# values like ``"agent-runtime:foo:bar"`` from round-tripping into
# storage and search.

    Applied at every MCP + CLI + Python-adapter surface that
    concatenates ``AGENT_NAMESPACE_PREFIX`` with caller input.
    Session-start: ``mem_session_start`` (MCP), ``mm session start`` /
    ``mm session wrap`` (CLI),
    ``integrations.langgraph.MemtomemStore.start_agent_session``
    (Python adapter). Multi-agent registration / search:
    ``mem_agent_register`` / ``mem_agent_search`` (MCP), ``mm agent
    register`` (CLI).

    Raises :class:`InvalidNameError` (a ``ValueError`` subclass,
    surfaced by ``tool_handler`` as ``"Error: ..."`` on the MCP path
    and as a ``ClickException`` on the CLI path) when the id contains
    ``:``, ``/``, ``..``, whitespace, control characters, or anything
    outside the canonical ``[A-Za-z0-9._-]`` charset documented above.

    The read/write contract is symmetric across all surfaces listed
    above: an id either works on every surface or fails on every
    surface. Pre-#493 the multi-agent surfaces silently called
    ``sanitize_namespace_segment`` instead, which let hostile shapes
    round-trip into storage under a rewritten namespace while
    ``mem_session_start`` rejected the same shape; pre-#492 the
    LangGraph adapter applied only an ``if not agent_id`` empty-check
    and likewise let malformed values through. See the
    ``Changed (BREAKING)`` entries in ``CHANGELOG.md`` (Unreleased) and
    issues #492 / #493 for the migration notes.
