"""Poll-on-request hot-reload of ``~/.memtomem/config.json`` + ``config.d/``.

The web server loads the user's ``config.json`` / ``config.d`` fragments once
at startup and caches the resulting :class:`Mem2MemConfig` on
``app.state.config``. Without this module, CLI edits made while the server is
running (``mm config set``, external editor, etc.) stay invisible to the
running server AND get silently clobbered the next time a UI handler calls
:func:`save_config_overrides` against its stale in-memory copy.

Design (see ``project_web_hot_reload_bridge.md`` for the full rationale):

* **Trigger**: every read/write handler calls :func:`reload_if_stale` which
  compares a composite ``(path, mtime_ns)`` signature of ``config.json`` plus
  every ``config.d/*.json`` entry to the last known signature. If anything
  changed, a fresh :class:`Mem2MemConfig` is built via the canonical load path
  (``Mem2MemConfig()`` → :func:`load_config_d` → :func:`load_config_overrides`)
  and swapped into ``app.state.config``.
* **Runtime fanout**: tokenizer changes rebuild the FTS5 index and every
  config change invalidates the search cache — see
  :func:`apply_runtime_config_changes`, shared between the PATCH handler and
  the reload path so a hot-reload applies the same side-effects as an
  in-process PATCH.
* **Failure mode**: if the reload raises (bad JSON, pydantic validation,
  permission error), the existing ``app.state.config`` is left in place and
  the error is recorded on ``app.state.last_reload_error`` so the FE can
  surface a banner. Write handlers refuse with HTTP 409 while the error is
  active for the current on-disk mtime.

The public surface is intentionally small: :func:`current_signature`,
:func:`reload_if_stale`, :func:`apply_runtime_config_changes`, and the
helpers :func:`get_config_mtime_ns`, :func:`get_reload_error`. Everything
else is private.
